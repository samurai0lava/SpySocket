TODO : make an array of server sockets (multiple servers)
TODO : loop on them and add them to epoll

we only have and need one port 

TODO : switch to c++98 later and add make_pair since you changed it to pair

TODO : check if all the locations in the config file needs to start with / (necessary when you want to route )

TODO : ask zahira if we can add other directives in the locations blocks like client-max-body-size or upload_directory 

when we find an error e.g 404 close the connection with the client where the error occured then remove it from epoll and clear the ressources
